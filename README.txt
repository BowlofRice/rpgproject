In order for the fonts to show properly, be sure to install the two fonts inside 
src/example to your fonts folder in your computer. Otherwise the font will appear 
too large and weird.

Hey guys i added a map one, and edited the players so there is a function to create them, 
which I forgot and will probably be useful.  The map one has a function which creates it
as well as a function to print it out, so tell me what you think, and I guess we can grow 
from here

Also, Am I saving the files in the wrong folder, do they go in src/ or bin/ im confused. thanks



3.30  I added a new map and flags for the characters, i also extended their levels to be able to go to level 5, which i think is better.  i stress the prophet must be exponentially bettter as time goes on because thats what makes sense, anyways lets keep in touch and let me know what you think of the maps and good luck with your stuff, i will get to making some enemies in a bit.3.30  I added a new map and flags for the characters, i also extended their levels to be able to go to level 5, which i think is better.  i stress the prophet must be exponentially bettter as time goes on because thats what makes sense, anyways lets keep in touch and let me know what you think of the maps and good luck with your stuff, i will get to making some enemies in a bit.3.30  I added a new map and flags for the characters, i also extended their levels to be able to go to level 5, which i think is better.  i stress the prophet must be exponentially bettter as time goes on because thats what makes sense, anyways lets keep in touch and let me know what you think of the maps and good luck with your stuff, i will get to making some enemies in a bit.
